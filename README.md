# steinuil/desu

Homebrew formulæ for the whole family.

## What works and whatnot

### `bam`
This is a building system for Teeworlds or something. It works, but it's pretty fucking useless if the game it builds doesn't work.

### `mpv073`
An old version of mpv. I keep in there because it's the last one to support `vo=opengl_old` and it still compiles on OS X 10.7. Fortunately I don't have to use it anymore, but who knows when it might be useful again.

### `noice`
Works just fine, I don't really feel like it's interesting enough to be in the main repo so I guess I'll just keep it here until I feel like trying.

### `pearpc`
It compiles just fine but it's reeeeeally slow. I wouldn't recommend actually using it.

### `teeworlds`
This doesn't work. I don't know why. Maybe one day I'll go in the teeworlds channel and ask why the fuck, but fuck doing that now.

### et al
I usually push formulæ I requested to merge in the official taps here first. Those work.

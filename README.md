# steinuil/desu

Homebrew formul√¶ for the whole family.

## What works and whatnot

### `arx-libertatis`

It just werks. The `--head` version doesn't compile on my machine though.

### `pearpc`

It compiles just fine, but it's slower than a slug climbing up a salt obelisk on a dry, sunny day.

It's just ***that*** slow.

Use it if you have a hexacore CPU from the future or something.

### `scumm-vm`

Can't remember whether this works or not. I just wanted some kind of formula for development version. It probably does.

I don't really want to wait for the whole thing to compile though, so whether this works or not will remain a mystery.

## Usage

    brew tap steinuil/desu

Use at your own risk. If something does not work out for you just file a bug or something.

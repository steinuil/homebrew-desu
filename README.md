# steinuil/desu

Homebrew formulæ for the whole family.

## What works and whatnot

### `bam`
This is a building system for Teeworlds or something. It works, but it's pretty fucking useless if the game it builds doesn't work.

### `ffmpeg`
This is just a fix for an [upstream issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/34963) with ffmpeg, hopefully it'll be fixed soon upstream or wherever.

### `mpv073`
You've probably guessed it, it's good ol' mpv v0.7.3, the last version to support `vo=opengl_old`, I'm keeping this because my toaster is a toaster and I can't watch muh chinese cartoons without mpv.

### `noice`
Works just fine, I don't really feel like it's interesting enough to be in the main repo so I guess I'll just keep it here until I feel like trying.

### `pearpc`
It compiles just fine but it's reeeeeally slow. Use it if you have a hexacore CPU from the future or something.

### `teeworlds`
This doesn't work. I don't know why. Maybe one day I'll go in the teeworlds channel and ask why the fuck, but fuck doing that now.

### et al
I usually push formulæ I requested to merge in the official taps here first. Those work.

## Usage

    brew tap steinuil/desu

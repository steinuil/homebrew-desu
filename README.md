# steinuil/desu

Homebrew formulæ for the whole family.

## What works and whatnot

### `bam`

This is a building system for Teeworlds or something. It works, but it's pretty 
fucking useless if the game it builds doesn't work.

### `ffmpeg`

This is just a fix for an upstream issue with ffmpeg, hopefully it'll be fixed
soon upstream or wherever.

### `noice`

Works just fine, I don't really feel like it's interesting enough to be in the
main repo so I guess I'll just keep it here until I feel like trying.

### `pearpc`

It compiles just fine but it's reeeeeally slow. Use it if you have a hexacore
CPU from the future or something.

### `teeworlds`

This doesn't work. I don't know why. Maybe one day I'll go in the teeworlds 
channel and ask why the fuck, but fuck doing that now.

### Other stuff

I usually push formulæ I requested to merge in the official taps here first.
Those work.

## Usage

    brew tap steinuil/desu

Use at your own risk. If something does not work out for you just file a bug or 
something.

# steinuil/desu

Homebrew formul√¶ for the whole family.

## What works and whatnot

### `bam`

This is a building system for Teeworlds or something. It works.

### `pearpc`

It compiles just fine, but it's slower than a slug climbing up a salt obelisk on a dry, sunny day.

It's just ***that*** slow.

Use it if you have a hexacore CPU from the future or something.

### `teeworlds`

This doesn't work. I don't know why. Maybe one day I'll go in the teeworlds channel and ask why the fuck, but fuck doing that now.

## Usage

    brew tap steinuil/desu

Use at your own risk. If something does not work out for you just file a bug or something.
